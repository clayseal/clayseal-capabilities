Brackets are 95% percentile bootstrap intervals resampling **tasks**, not events: events within a task share a template, so an event-level interval would be roughly sqrt(events-per-task) too narrow. _Tasks_ is the resampling unit count. Two engines whose intervals overlap are not distinguishable on this corpus.
